# Fake News Detection

## Backstory

Fake news denotes a type of yellow press which intentionally presents misinformation or hoaxes spreading through both traditional print news media and recent online social media. In recent years, due to the booming developments of online social networks, fake news for various commercial and political purposes has been appearing in large numbers and widespread in the online world. With deceptive words, online social network users can get infected by these online fake news easily, which has brought about tremendous effects on the offline society already.

So, it is important to detect fake and real news.

## Data

The dataset has downloaded from this kaggle website [link](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). It has 1000 rows, 46.8% of them represnt the fake news
whereas the other 53.2% represent the true news, and since the fake news are not much less than the true news the dataset is balanced.
The dataset has been cleaned by removing duplicates and stopwords. In addition, it was tokenized and lemmatized.

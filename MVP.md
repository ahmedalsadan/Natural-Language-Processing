The above right graph represents the count of the words for each fake news text versus the density, and the above left graph represents the count of the words for each true news text versus the density.
The fake news graph shows that the majority of the fake news texts fall in the range of 10-20 words, whereas the true news graph has less average of the count of the words because as shown the majority
of the true news texts fall in the range of 7.5-12.5 .

The graph and lists above show that the most frequent words of the true and fake news. The dark red points represent the most frequent words of the fake news, whereas the
dark blue points represent the most frequent words of the true news. Also, the graph shows that the data need more cleaning.
